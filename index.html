    <p>More work to do for the workers I met in Galesburg, Ill., who are losing their union jobs at the
        Maytag plant
        that's moving to Mexico, and now are having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an
        hour. But we also know that government initiatives are not enough. That has been my experience at Trinity. And
        they are a part of America, this country that I love. For peace to come, it is time for them - and all of us -
        to live up to our responsibilities.
        <br />
        <br />
        This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for
        twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure
        when he went home to tell his family the news. This has bred more fear and mistrust. And I believe that America
        holds within her the truth that regardless of race, religion, or station in life, all of us share common
        aspirations - to live in peace and security; to get an education and to work with dignity; to love our families,
        our communities, and our God. And so in that spirit, let me speak as clearly and plainly as I can about some
        specific issues that I believe we must finally confront together. This is not simply about America's interests.
        <br />
        <br />
        It should help us, not hurt us. So let there be no doubt: Islam is a part of America. In all nations - including
        my own - this change can bring fear.
        <br />

        He grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin-roof shack. Now, as children of God, we believe in the worth
        and dignity of every human being; it doesn't matter where that person came from or what documents they have. We
        can tackle race only as spectacle - as we did in the OJ trial - or in the wake of tragedy, as we did in the
        aftermath of Katrina - or as fodder for the nightly news. And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and
        more accountability.
        <br />

        While studying here, my father met my mother. After the war, they studied on the G.I. And I will not settle for
        an America where some kids don't have that chance. We are shaped by every culture, drawn from every end of the
        Earth, and dedicated to a simple concept: E pluribus unum: "Out of many, one." Denying that fact is baseless,
        ignorant, and hateful.
        <br />
        <br />
        We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and
        the American promise has been threatened once more. It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and
        innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American
        jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road.
        <br />
        <br />
        America, now is not the time for small plans. troops and civilians.
        <br />
        <br />
        It was because of these newfound understandings that I was finally able to walk down the aisle of Trinity one
        day and affirm my Christian faith. It's an idea that's often forgotten or dismissed in cynical times. When
        violent extremists operate in one stretch of mountains, people are endangered across an ocean.
        <br />
        <br />
        There is not a Black America and a White America and Latino America and Asian America - there's the United
        States of America. They stood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, as the blows of billy clubs rained down. The children
        of America are not those kids, they are our kids, and we will not let them fall behind in a 21st century
        economy.
        <br />
        <br />
        And we should close Guantanamo Bay and stop tolerating the torture of our enemies. And so this will be a
        difficult debate next week. I have already condemned, in unequivocal terms, the statements of Reverend Wright
        that have caused such controversy. For the African-American community, that path means embracing the burdens of
        our past without becoming victims of our past. I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight
        against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. We must always examine the ways in which we protect it.
        <br />
        <br />
        But the truth is, that isn't all that I know of the man. I am grateful for your hospitality, and the hospitality
        of the people of Egypt. There is also one rule that lies at the heart of every religion - that we do unto others
        as we would have them do unto us.
        <br />
        <br />
        Religious leaders like my friends Rev. Jim Wallis and Rabbi David Saperstein and Nathan Diament are working for
        justice and fighting for change. And fault lines must be closed among Muslims as well, as the divisions between
        Sunni and Shia have led to tragic violence, particularly in Iraq.
        <br />
        <br />
        It came about as a choice, and not an epiphany. And we should close Guantanamo Bay and stop tolerating the
        torture of our enemies. As a young man, I worked in Chicago communities where many found dignity and peace in
        their Muslim faith. They have killed in many countries. But we have a responsibility to join together on behalf
        of the world we seek - a world where extremists no longer threaten our people, and American troops have come
        home; a world where Israelis and Palestinians are each secure in a state of their own, and nuclear energy is
        used for peaceful purposes; a world where governments serve their citizens, and the rights of all God's children
        are respected.
        <br />
        <br />
        John Kerry understands the ideals of community, faith, and service because they've defined his life. And it's a
        testament to what we can achieve when good people with strong convictions stand up for their beliefs. This
        belief comes from my unyielding faith in the decency and generosity of the American people. I've seen it in
        Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give
        better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands.
        <br />
        <br />
        I wanted to be part of something larger. I learned that those things I was too weak to accomplish myself, He
        would accomplish with me if I placed my trust in Him.

        Thank you.</p>
